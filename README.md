# Gender-Specific-Equipment-Tables

Separate equipment tables for males and females in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim

Allows modders to add single-gender armors/equipment to leveled NPCs without having them show up on an unsupported gender.

Depends on [MXPF](https://github.com/matortheeternal/mxpf).
